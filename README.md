# Retro Games Store: Web Layout Explorations

## Project Overview
This repository contains a series of academic projects focused on mastering various **HTML5** and **CSS3** layout techniques. Using a "Retro Games Online" store as a consistent theme, the project demonstrates the evolution from traditional table-based layouts to modern block-based styling and responsive design principles.

## Technical Implementation
The project is divided into several architectural approaches to web styling:

* **Semantic Web Interface (`index.html`):** A main landing page using semantic HTML tags, featuring product cards, a comparison table of classic titles like Super Mario Bros and DOOM, and a functional contact form.
* **CSS Architecture (`style.css`):** Implementation of external stylesheets using:
    * Advanced selectors including tags, classes, IDs, and descendant selectors.
    * Interactive UI elements with `hover` effects and smooth `transition` animations.
    * Customized typography and box-shadow styling.
* **Layout Strategies:**
    * **Fixed Block Layout (`float-fixed.html`):** Positioning elements using `float` properties with a fixed container width of 640px.
    * **Fluid Table Layout (`table-fluid.html`):** Creating flexible structures that adapt to 100% of the viewport width.
    * **Fixed Table Layout (`table-fixed.html`):** Precise control of layout using traditional HTML tables with fixed pixel widths.

## Key Files
* `index.html` — The primary storefront prototype.
* `style.css` — Global styles with a focus on UI/UX and clean design.
* `zvit-lr2.html` — Detailed technical report covering CSS inheritance, selectors, and styling methods.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Structural HTML:** Proficiency in using tables, nested lists, and forms.
* **CSS Mastery:** Understanding of the box model, float-based positioning, and responsive design.
* **Documentation:** Ability to document technical implementation and theory in structured reports.

## Preview
The project showcases retro gaming classics such as:
* **Super Mario Bros** (Platformer, NES, 1985).
* **DOOM** (Shooter, MS-DOS, 1993).
* **Sonic the Hedgehog**.
