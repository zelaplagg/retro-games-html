Retro Games Store: Web Layout Explorations
📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a series of academic projects focused on mastering various HTML5 and CSS3 layout techniques. Using a "Retro Games Online" store as a consistent theme, the project demonstrates the evolution from traditional table-based layouts to modern block-based styling and responsive design principles.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
The project is divided into several architectural approaches to web styling:

Semantic Web Interface (index.html): A main landing page using semantic HTML tags, featuring product cards, a comparison table of classic titles (Mario, DOOM), and a functional contact form.

CSS Architecture (style.css): Implementation of external stylesheets using:

Advanced selectors (ID, class, descendant, and attribute selectors).

Interactive UI elements with hover effects and smooth transition animations.

Customized typography and box-shadow styling.

Layout Strategies:

Fixed Block Layout (float-fixed.html): Positioning elements using float properties with a fixed container width.

Fluid Table Layout (table-fluid.html): Creating flexible structures that adapt to 100% of the viewport width.

Fixed Table Layout (table-fixed.html): Precise control of layout using traditional HTML tables.
